# Stamp

Print your own stamp designs!


## Print Settings

You should print this model with the following settings:

- Up until `Stamp_Height` (Base)
	- 0.2mm layer height
	- 15% infill (depending on the stamp size more/less is required/sufficient)
	- enable ironing of top surfaces (makes for a cleaner bottom of the stamp)
- Starting from `Stamp_Height` (Stencil)
	- 0.15mm layer height
	- 100% infill (or increase the number of perimeters)
	- disable ironing (sanding the stamp at the end is required anyway)

You might want to configure a filament change when switching from printing the base to the stencil.
Printing the stencil with TPU or some other flexible filament results in easier stamping.

To finish the model, sand the underside of the stencil until everything has the same height and is smooth.
